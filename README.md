  # How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  You be sure that your code is secure by utilizing software testing techniques. Some of these techniques like:
     - Manual Testing
     - Unit Testing
     - Integration Testing
     - Regression Testing
     - Performance Testing
     - Security Testing
     
  These tests allow us to test our system under certain paramaters. This ensures that the system has proper functionality, is secure and meets performance requirments.
  
  # How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  You can interpret the users needs through many different ways.
     - User Interviews
     - Surveys
     - Usability testing
     
  Each of these are great ways for the community to express what they would like from your system. Usability testing is especially useful for the fact that user don't necessarily have to put in any effort to help the team with understanding their needs.
  
  # How do I approach designing software?
  For approaching system design of software, we can follow the System Design Life Cycle:
      1. Planning
      2. Feasibility Study
      3. System Design
      4. Implementation
      5. Testing
      6. Deployment
      7. Maintentance
      
  Each of these steps allow for us to thorough design our system.
